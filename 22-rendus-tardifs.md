Voici une observation sur les rendus tardifs, dans le livre de Meredith Davis "*Teaching Design*" (2017):

> Faculty should expect students to behave like students, not trainees. Their intellectual output builds across time, not in some last-minute rush to the finish line. 
>
> A consistent pattern of late work is usually a symptom of something else, not students' disregard for the demands of the workplace they hope to enter. Work is often late because faculty did not account for student's failures, flagging self-confidence, or reflection in their pacing of interim project deadlines.
>
> Students successfully hide when they are lost in solving a problem, and their confusion becomes apparent only in the final critique. It is the role of faculty to model a reflective practice in pacing the work of a studio and to coordinate conflicting demands on students' time with colleagues in other courses. 
>
> Late work is not a problem fixed by punitive policies or scaring students into compliance.
